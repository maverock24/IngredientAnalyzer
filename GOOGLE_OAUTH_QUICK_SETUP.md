# ðŸ”§ Quick Google OAuth Setup

**You need to complete these steps to fix the "OAuth client was not found" error:**

## Step 1: Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Create or select a project**
3. **Enable APIs**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API" and enable it
   - Also enable "Google Identity Services API"

4. **Create OAuth Credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Web application"

5. **Configure Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081
   http://localhost:19006
   https://your-app-name.netlify.app (when you deploy)
   ```

6. **Copy your Client ID** - it will look like:
   ```
   123456789-abcdefghijklmnop.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

## Step 2: Update Your Local Environment

1. **Open the `.env` file** in your project root
2. **Replace the placeholder** with your actual Client ID:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abcdefghijklmnop.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

## Step 3: Test the Setup

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```

2. **Try logging in** - you should now see the Google OAuth screen

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "This app isn't verified"
