# ðŸ”§ Fix for OAuth Issues - UPDATED

## The Problem

You were getting:

1. "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.close call"
2. "client_secret is missing" error
3. Loading icon stays on screen

## âœ… The Solution (FIXED!)

I've updated the code to use the **implicit OAuth flow** which doesn't require a client secret and works better for web applications.

### Step 1: Add the Correct Redirect URI to Google Cloud Console

From your console log, I can see your app is using: **`http://localhost:8081`**

1. **Go to**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Navigate to**: APIs & Services â†’ Credentials
3. **Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
4. **In "Authorized redirect URIs", add**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Your OAuth Client Correctly

Make sure your Google OAuth Client is set up as:

- **Application type**: Web application
- **Authorized redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:8081`

### Step 3: Test the Fixed Authentication

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 to clear cache)
2. **Click "Continue with Google"**
3. **Complete the OAuth flow**
4. **The popup should close automatically**
5. **You should be logged in!**

## What I Fixed

- âœ… **Switched to implicit flow**: No more client_secret requirement
- âœ… **Simplified token handling**: Direct access token from Google
- âœ… **Better error messages**: You'll see exactly what went wrong
- âœ… **Proper redirect URI**: Using `http://localhost:8081`

## Expected Behavior Now

1. Click "Continue with Google"
2. Google OAuth popup opens
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. Popup closes automatically
5. You're logged into the app with your profile showing

## Still Having Issues?

If it's still not working:

1. **Make sure the redirect URI is exactly**: `http://localhost:8081`
2. **Clear browser cache completely**
3. **Check that you're using the right Google Client ID**
4. **Make sure the Google+ API is enabled** in your project

The implicit flow should work much better for web applications!
