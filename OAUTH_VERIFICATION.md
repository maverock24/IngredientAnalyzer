# ✅ Netlify OAuth Verification Checklist

## Current Status: Environment Variables Set ✅

I can see you've successfully added:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` ✅
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` ✅

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Verify Google Cloud Console Redirect URIs

**Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/

- Navigate to: APIs & Services → Credentials
- Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Client ID: `139734881985-1lbdr2gg837l09ui22nj4fvagh5ls3vu`)
- **Make sure "Authorized redirect URIs" contains BOTH**:
  ```
  http://localhost:8081
  https://check-that.netlify.app
  ```

### 2. Redeploy Your Netlify Site

Since you just added the environment variable:

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/check-that/deploys
2. **Click**: "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
3. **Wait for deployment** to complete (should take 1-2 minutes)

### 3. Test Production OAuth

After redeployment:

1. **Visit**: https://check-that.netlify.app/
2. **You should NOT see**: "Google OAuth is not configured" message
3. **You should see**: The normal login screen with "Continue with Google" button
4. **Click "Continue with Google"** to test the OAuth flow

## Expected Results

✅ **Success**: Google OAuth popup opens and you can sign in
❌ **Still failing**: Check the troubleshooting steps below

## Troubleshooting If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Verify Environment Variable

- Go to Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables
- Confirm `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is exactly: `139734881985-1lbdr2gg837l09ui22nj4fvagh5ls3vu.apps.googleusercontent.com`

### Check 2: Check Build Logs

- Go to Netlify dashboard → Deploys
- Click on the latest deploy
- Check build logs for any environment variable issues

### Check 3: Browser Console

- Open https://check-that.netlify.app/
- Press F12 → Console tab
- Look for any error messages about client ID or OAuth

### Check 4: Google Cloud Console

- Verify the redirect URI `https://check-that.netlify.app` is saved correctly
- Make sure there are no typos in the URL

## Next Action

**Please complete steps 1 and 2 above, then test the production site and let me know what happens!**
